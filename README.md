# Parking-Space-Detecion-Using-Computer-Vision
In this parking space detection project, image processing techniques were utilized for their simplicity and effectiveness compared to complex neural network methods. Real-time video feeds from CCTV cameras were used, with parking slots manually marked as Regions of Interest (ROI). The system converted cropped images to grayscale and binary images, applying Gaussian blur and adaptive thresholding to determine occupancy based on pixel count thresholds. The number of available free parking spots was then displayed on a user interface.
